# iStruct2D-iPadOS-Demo

This project is my individual project that is the further development of the iStruct2D Python

iStruct2D Python: https://github.com/wengchonglao0124/iStruct2D-Python.git

This project aims to develop a prototype for the structural analysis software by using Swift on iOS and iPadOS system.
Allowing users to use only 4 actions - TAP, SWIPE, PINCH, TWIRL - to analyse the 2D simply supported beam structure.

Comparing to the traditional structural analysis software, the result presentation of iStruct2D iPadOS Demo is interactive and
changes instantly as the input condition is altered giving users an immediate visualization of the impact on structural behaviour.

Main development file: GameScene.swift


## Usage

The development, study and outcome of this project can be used in the future development of the comprehensive structural analysis software, 
it proved that the innovative user interface and interaction can be implemented into the application for structural engineering discipline.
